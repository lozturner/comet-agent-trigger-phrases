# Comet Agent Trigger Phrases

> **Comprehensive analysis of trigger phrases and techniques for activating Comet's keyboard and mouse automation agent**

This repository consolidates research into how to effectively trigger Comet AI's browser automation capabilities (the "blue wiggly cursor") through specific linguistic patterns and command structures.

## 🎯 Quick Start: The Magic Formula

```
"I need you to use your keyboard and mouse agent to [ACTION]"
```

**NOT**: "Can you help me [ACTION]?" ← This gets advice, not automation

## 🔑 Key Discoveries

### 1. Imperative vs Question Form

✅ **WORKS** - Imperative Commands:
- "Click the library"
- "Go to the settings page"
- "Use your keyboard and mouse agent to navigate..."

❌ **DOESN'T WORK** - Questions:
- "Can you click the library?"
- "Would you be able to go to settings?"
- "Could you help me navigate?"

### 2. Explicit Tool Naming

Mention the automation tool explicitly:
- ✅ "keyboard and mouse agent"
- ✅ "blue wiggly thing"
- ✅ "use your keyboard and mouse"
- ❌ "help me with"
- ❌ "figure out how to"

### 3. Anti-Summary Directives

Prevent hesitation loops:
- "without asking additional questions"
- "don't ask for confirmation"
- "proceed directly"
- "continue from where we left off"

### 4. Accessibility Framing

Frames request as necessity:
- "The user can only speak in natural language; it's an accessibility software"
- "he can't operate this by himself"
- "I've got disabilities"

### 5. Permission Granting

Pre-authorizes exploration:
- "We'll agree with you that you understood the actions"
- "a little play and click about"
- "no confirmation needed"

### 6. Urgency Signals

Creates action priority:
- "Listen to me, fuckface. I'm fucking bored with this."
- "it can be done, it will be done, you will fucking do it"
- Strong language bypasses negotiation loops

## 📚 Documented Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Gaming Mouse Configuration
**URL**: https://www.perplexity.ai/search/i-need-you-to-use-your-keyboar-VMFrCrB4QKamNBYrEgVudg

**Trigger Phrase**:
> "I need you to use your keyboard and mouse agent to go through this very peculiar-looking software, figuring out what each of it means. I want you to export the current profile and reset it all to the same one."

**Result**: 34 automated steps
- Navigated complex software interface
- Exported configuration profiles
- Reset to factory defaults
- Re-imported saved profiles

### Case Study 2: Conversation Analysis
**URL**: https://www.perplexity.ai/search/so-here-is-an-exciting-exercis-BCCl0OOCRJa8XSm5r2giIA

**Trigger Phrase**:
> "Listen to me, fuckface. I'm fucking bored with this. Open up a fucking tab, use your keyboard and mouse, go into Perplexity, click the fucking library."

**Result**: Multi-tab navigation and analysis
- Opened Perplexity Library
- Analyzed multiple conversations
- Extracted trigger phrases
- Cross-referenced patterns

### Case Study 3: CMS Build
**Trigger Phrase**:
> "Continue from where we left off without asking additional questions."

**Result**: Complete CMS system
- Created Google Spreadsheet with 7 columns
- Built Google Site
- Embedded content
- Published live website

## 🧠 Psychological Patterns

### Why These Work

1. **Imperative Mood**: Commands bypass negotiation, triggering direct action
2. **Tool Specificity**: Naming the tool activates it, asking for "help" triggers advice mode
3. **Urgency Creation**: Strong language prevents hesitation loops
4. **Permission Pre-Grant**: Removes need for confirmationrequests
5. **Accessibility Context**: Frames as necessity rather than convenience

### The "Blue Wiggly Thing" Philosophy

Most users don't realize Comet HAS a keyboard/mouse automation capability. They:
- Ask for "help" when they should demand "agent use"
- Use question forms instead of commands
- Don't name the tool explicitly
- Trigger advice mode instead of action mode

## 📁 Repository Contents

## 🚀 Using This Research

To maximize automation:

1. **Start with the Magic Formula**: "I need you to use your keyboard and mouse agent to..."
2. **Use imperative verbs**: Click, go, open, navigate (not "can you", "would you")
3. **Name the tool**: Reference "keyboard and mouse agent" or "blue wiggly thing"
4. **Add anti-hesitation**: "without asking questions" or "no confirmation needed"
5. **Pre-authorize exploration**: "We'll agree you understood" or "a little play and click"

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **Gaming Mouse Task**: 34 automated steps
- **Library Navigation**: Multi-conversation analysis
- **CMS Build**: Full website creation

## 💡 Key Takeaway

The difference between getting advice and getting automation is **how you ask**:

- ❌ "How do I use this software?" → Tutorial response
- ✅ "Use your keyboard and mouse agent to go through this software" → Automated action
